a) to determine all questions relating to the rights and eligibility of players and
non-playing captains whose names have been submitted by a NBO for
invitation to compete in an APBF Championship or Congress or Asia Cup,
taking into account the reports (if any) received from NBOs regarding
previous proceedings involving suspension of or disciplinary proceedings
against players under their jurisdiction. The names of players and non-
playing captains submitted by the NBOs for invitation to an APBF
Championship or Congress or Asia Cup must be transmitted to the
President, or his designee, in writing, as prescribed by the relevant
Supplementary Conditions of Contest;
b) in its discretion, to refuse to invite any player or non-playing captain whose

case of refusal, the Credentials Committee shall give no reason.
```
## 4.3 Eligibility Requirements

satisfies the birth and residence requirements of the NBO nominating him
belongs as follows:
```

```
Except for those players being nominated for participation in any APBF Youth
Championship or Transnational Event (as defined by the Executive Committee), to
determine that any competitor in an APBF Tournament must be a national of the
country of the NBO entering him for participation, or the player has been a resident
in the NBO concerned during three years out of the five years immediately preceding
the date of the Tournament, or the player has lived six months immediately
preceding the Tournament in the NBO concerned, subject to the following:
i) If a competitor is a national of two or more countries at the same time, he may
represent either one of them, as he may elect.
ii) If a competitor has represented one country in an APBF Championship or WBF
Tournament and has changed his nationality or acquired a new nationality, he
shall not participate in an APBF Championship to represent his new country
until after three years of such change or acquisition. This period may be
reduced or even cancelled upon the request of the NBO with the approval of
the APBF Executive Committee.
iii) If a new NBO is affiliated as a member of APBF, a competitor may continue to
represent the country to which he belongs or belonged. However, he may, if he
prefers, choose to represent his country or be entered in an APBF Championship
by his new NBO if one exists. This particular choice may be made only once.
No male shall be a playing member of, or a substitute player in, a team or pair
competing in a women’s event.
```
## 4.4 Over-Riding Eligibility Regulations

```

English is the official language of an APBF Championship or Congress or Asia Cup. During a
match the players may converse only in English unless both captains (in team events) or all
four players at the table (in pair’s events) agree to use some other common language at their
own risk. If necessary, each captain is responsible for the provision of an interpreter for
translation into English. The Laws printed in English will be used by the Tournament
Directors to adjudicate irregularities. No request for review due to misunderstanding in a
language other than English will be entertained.


## 6. Ethics And Deportment

## 6.1 Player’s Obligation

```
All contestants in APBF Championships or Congress or Asia Cup are required
to conform at all times to the highest standards of ethics and deportment.
The APBF expects all teams and partnerships to play to win at all times and in
all circumstances. All contestants (including non-playing captains) are also
expected to accept the decisions made by the championship authorities in a
courteous and sportsmanlike manner.
```
## 6.2 Looking at Partner

```
Players are requested not to look at their partners during play of a hand. The
objective is to avoid any suggestion of unethical communication.
```
## 6.3 Anti-Betting Regulation

```
It shall be a violation for any player, team captain or official, or any other
persons associated with or related to a player, team captain or official
participating in any APBF event to wager on the results of any such event or
part thereof. Any violation will be subject to charges to be presented to a
hearing before the APBF Executive Committee.
```
## 7. Anti-Doping Regulations

It is mandatory for all participants to follow the WBF Anti-Doping regulations adopted by
the APBF detailed in Appendix 5.

## 8. Dress Code

NBOs are asked to take note of the recognition of Bridge as a Sport by the IOC and
requests that players should, at all times, be dressed appropriately; this is particularly the
case at the Opening Ceremony and at the Prize Giving Ceremony or Victory Banquet, when
it is expected that teams should at least be uniformly dressed even if a team uniform is not
available. During play appropriate dress would, for example, be an open-necked shirt, or a
smart polo or sweatshirt worn with trousers or skirt as appropriate.

## 9. Restrictions

The following restrictions apply to the playing areas (see definition of these areas in Section
2.15).

## 9.1 Smoking and Alcohol

```
Smoking and the consumption of alcoholic beverages of any nature in the
playing area are prohibited. No player may leave the playing area in order to
smoke or consume alcohol before the end of his match. Any player or team
official smoking or consuming alcohol before, during or after the session in
these areas will result in his team being fined 2 VPs, or in the case of pairs
events, will result in his partnership being fined 25% of the match points
available on a board during the session. Constant violation of this regulation
will result in the player being prohibited from playing and in the team official
not being admitted into the playing area.
```

## 9.2 Mobile Phones and Electronic Devices

```
Mobile telephones and electronic devices may not be brought into the playing
area and toilets. Any player or team official bringing such an item into these
areas will result in his team being fined 2 VPs or in the case of pairs events,
will result in his partnership being fined 25% of the match points available on a
board during the session. This penalty is mandatory. Constant violation of this
regulation will result in the player being prohibited from playing and in the
team official not being admitted into the playing area. The Chief Tournament
Director may, at his discretion, prohibit a player from bringing other
equipment into the playing area. Anyone entering the playing area may be
required to comply with procedures put in place by the APBF for the
detection of such electronic equipment. See also Section 28.1 for restrictions
pertaining to spectators.
The Chief Tournament Director will arrange for random checks of players
and team officials to ensure that there is compliance with these prohibitions.
Refusal to submit to these checks will bar the individual concerned from the
playing area and toilet area for the duration of the match or until such time as
the Chief Tournament Director in consultation with the Executive
Committee shall decide.
```
## 10. Disqualification from any APBF Championship or Congress or Asia Cup

Should a team, pair or individual play be disqualified as a result of a decision made by the
Executive Committee, no refund of the entry fees, either in part or in whole, will be made.

## 11. Vu-Graph

All contestants are required to play on Vu-Graph whenever assigned to do so by the
President or his designee. In the absence of any contrary stipulation, the room from which
play is broadcast to the Vu-Graph audience shall be the Open Room.

## 12. Media Presentation

Players are required to participate in any public presentation of matches, interviews etc
arranged by the APBF, including video, Internet, TV, radio or any other media presentation.

## 13. Completion of WBF Convention Card

## 13.1 Publication of Systems

```
Registration of Convention Cards with the APBF gives the APBF the right to
publish such convention cards via Internet or to any parties at the
Championship or Congress or Asia Cup in such form as it sees fit. When full
systems are registered on site, for the purposes of providing additional
information, these will not be published by the APBF to persons other than
those requiring them for the purpose of running the Tournament.
```
## 13.2 Requirements

```
Contestants are required to make full written disclosure of their System and
also to make a full disclosure of the meaning of any call or play in response to
```

```
a proper question at the table from an opponent. The Supplementary
Conditions of Contest will set forth detailed procedures for that disclosure, in
accordance with the WBF Systems Policy and in addition to rules established
in these Conditions of Contest.
The full written disclosure referred to in the above paragraph is made by the
completion in due form of the WBF Convention Card and Supplementary
Sheets as required. Partnerships are required to file their Convention Cards
and Supplementary Sheets in accordance with the Supplementary Conditions
of Contest. A Card will not be regarded as having been completed in due
form for the purposes of this section unless:
a) all sections of the Card have been accurately and legibly completed, in
English, in accordance with the Guide to Completion, these Conditions of
Contest, and the Supplementary Conditions of Contest;
b) the Card and Supplementary Sheets contain a clear and sufficient
explanation of the System used, including, without limitation, all
competitive agreements and understandings, it being accepted by the
APBF that the full particulars of some sequences (such as relays) which
occur in later rounds of the auction, may be omitted from the Card
without such omission constituting a breach of the requirement that the
Card contain a clear and sufficient explanation of the System;
c) the type of System and its appropriate colour are duly indicated in the
prescribed place on the Card.
d) any appropriate Brown Sticker or other forms required by the WBF
Systems Policy are fully completed and appended to the Card.
```
## 13.3 Supplementary Sheets

```
a) The WBF Convention Card may be supplemented by the addition of
Supplementary Sheets. The function of the Supplementary Sheets is to
facilitate the full disclosure of Systems and the relationship of material on
a Supplementary Sheet to material on a Card should be clearly indicated
by corresponding numbers on both the Card and the Supplementary
Sheet.
b) The number of Supplementary Sheets allowed, as well as the procedures
for amendment and variation of Convention Cards will be set forth in the
Supplementary Conditions of Contest.
```
## 13.4 General

```
a) If a player makes use of any conventional call not sufficiently described on
his Card (including Supplementary Sheets), that player’s partnership may
be subject to a procedural penalty (Law 90) for the infraction and/or to
disciplinary penalty as well as to score adjustments to redress any damage.
b) The onus of disclosure is on the user. When there is a claim of damage
through inadequate disclosure, the Tournament Director will give the
benefit of any doubt to the opponents.
```
## 14. Use of Convention Card at Table

Unless otherwise set forth in the Supplementary Conditions of Contest, each member of a
pair must hand to one of his opponents at the table during each Session of an event his duly
completed Card and Supplementary Sheet(s) (incorporating any variations made pursuant to


the provisions of the Supplementary Conditions of Contest for a specific APBF
Championship or Congress or Asia Cup) which shall contain in the designated place on the
Card an indication of the appropriate colour. These are to be reclaimed at the end of the
Session. After withdrawing his cards from the board and until they are restored at the
conclusion of the play, a player may not consult his own Card or Supplementary Sheets. He
may consult the WBF Convention Booklet in respect of a call made by an opponent, but not
in respect of a call made by his partner, or one made or contemplated by himself, and he
may consult written defences against Brown sticker conventions and HUM-aspects in his
opponents system.

## 15. Alerts and Explanations

An alertable call is defined in the WBF Alerting Policy (see Appendix 2: WBF Alerting
Policy). Subject to the provisions of Section 25.2 when screens are in use, the partner of a
player who has made an alertable call must immediately alert his opponents unless they have
stated, before the auction started on the first board of the set that they do not wish to be
alerted. It is the responsibility of the alerting player to alert clearly. No explanation of the
meaning of the alertable call should be made unless requested by an opponent. Request for
explanation of an alertable call may be deferred until later in the auction, or until after the
auction has closed in accordance with Law 20.

## 16. WBF Convention Booklet

Except in the case of initial action, whether offensive or defensive, showing two or more
specified suits (for which the suits involved must be specified on the convention card) a
reference on the Card to the name of a convention described in the WBF Convention
Booklet which is contained on the WBF CCE or within the WBF Guide to Completion
(obtainable from [http://www.ecatsbridge.com](http://www.ecatsbridge.com) Documents section) shall be deemed to incorporate
on the Card the full text of the relevant convention as described in the WBF Convention
Booklet. Should any modification of the description contained in the WBF Convention
Booklet be used, sufficient details of such modification must appear on the Card in the
appropriate section where the subject convention is named. No modification should be
written on the WBF Convention Booklet itself.

## 17. Non-Playing Captains in Team Tournaments

## 17.1 General

```
A non-playing captain (NPC) may observe his team during play subject to the
rules set forth in this Section and to any supplementary regulation made from
time to time by the APBF before an APBF Championship or Congress or Asia
Cup begins. The NPC must enter the room before play begins at the start of
a Session, and if the NPCs of both teams are in the room, they shall sit on the
same side of the screen. In case of dispute the “Home Team” captain shall
decide on which side of the screen they will sit. A NPC may observe play in
the Closed Room at the discretion of the Chief Tournament Director.
```
## 17.2 Procedure during matches

```
a) A NPC who leaves the room, except as provided in this Section, cannot
return during that Session. Exceptionally, if the NPC is requested to leave
```

```
the playing room (for the purpose of consultation or for whatever reason)
by a Tournament Director, the President, or the Chairman of the
Organising Committee, he may (but need not) be permitted to return to
that playing room at the discretion of the Tournament Director.
b) A NPC is bound to the same restrictions as spectators (Law 76), except
that he may intervene to restrain misbehaviour or curtail unnecessary
discussion on the part of his team members, and may with the
concurrence of the Tournament Director speak to questions of fact or
law, after the Tournament Director has been called to the table, but may
not call the Tournament Director.
c) During the time allowed for a Session, whether play is actually taking place
at the moment or not, a NPC should not address members of his team at
the table in any but the English language or in a language understood by
the opponents. If it is desired to use a language other than English, the
permission of the opponents should be sought, and, where reasonably
possible, should be given. If difficulty arises, a NPC wishing to speak to his
team in a language not known to the opponents should do so through an
interpreter or team member who can translate for the benefit of the
opponents.
d) At any time when a comparison of scores is allowed a non-playing Captain
may draw his players’ attention to his observation of an infraction but he
is bound as a spectator by Law 76B until that time.
```
## 17.3 Delegation of responsibility by the NPC

```
NPCs are responsible for the performance of various functions detailed in
these Conditions of Contest and the Supplementary Conditions of Contest.
While the APBF recognises the importance of other team officials (such as
coach, etc.), it is only when they are specifically named by the NPC, and have
been invited to participate in the relevant APBF Championship or Congress
or Asia Cup by the APBF, that they may perform certain of the official
functions assigned to the NPC. Such additional team officials may not enter
the playing rooms unless they obtain the permission of the APBF President
and the President may impose conditions on such entrance in his discretion.
```
## 18. Substitutes in Team Tournaments

If, for any reason, a team is unable to produce four players, either at the start of a session or
because of an emergency that develops during the session, the Chief Tournament Director,
in consultation with the captain of the team, may designate a substitute to complete the
team. A substitute need not be a member of the NBO represented by the team on which he
or she substitutes, but must not be a player from another team and may not be a male in the
case of an event restricted to women.

The Chief Tournament Director, having designated a substitute, shall inform the
Tournament Organising Committee and the Executive Committee as soon as practicable.
The results obtained by the substitute shall stand unless the Executive Committee judges
that the substitute’s bridge skills were considerably greater than those of the player replaced,
in which case an adjusted score may be determined. Whether or not the result stands, the
Executive Committee may impose appropriate penalties when it judges a team to be at fault.


The Executive Committee shall have authority to determine whether, and to what extent, a
substitute may become a permanent replacement.

## 19. Substitutes in Pair Tournaments

The Chief Tournament Director may make emergency substitutions whenever they are
necessary to the smooth operation of the game. If this will, or may, cause the resultant
disqualification of any contestant, the contestant shall, where practicable, be notified at the
time the substitution is made.

## 20. Forfeits in Team Tournaments

If a team is unable to play or complete a match, the Executive Committee may find that team
to be in default and declare the match forfeited or postponed. The team in forfeit shall score
zero Victory Points and zero IMPs for that match. The team winning the forfeited match will
receive the best score between: (a) 12 VPs using the 20-0 VP scale, (b) the team’s average,
or (c) the average score obtained by all the other opponents against the team at fault,
whichever is greater. If it is, or becomes, necessary also to assign an IMP score for tie
breaking or carry-over purposes, the winning team shall be credited with the average
number of IMPs, rounded up, which earn the assigned Victory Points score.

## 21. Substitute Boards in Team Tournaments

A “substitute board” is one introduced into play in a session or a match, to replace a board
already played at one or both tables. Depending upon the decision of the Chief Tournament
Director, the results of a substitute board may, or may not, be counted as part of the
session or match. Substitute boards are put into play by the Tournament Director either on
his own volition or by direction of the Chief Tournament Director.

## 22. Fouled Boards

A board is considered “fouled” if the Tournament Director determines that one or more
cards were misplaced in the board in such a manner that contestants who should have direct
comparison did not play the board in identical form. If in a team event a pre-duplicated
board is wrongly dealt and Law 13 of the Laws of Duplicate Bridge 2007 applies in such a
way that the board cannot be played, the board is considered to be a fouled board.

## 22.1 Fouled Boards in Team Tournaments

```
A board is not considered fouled if the boards played in the same match are
identical even though that board may differ from the like numbered board
played in simultaneous matches. In general, a fouled board should be replayed
through the substitution of a new board. In addition, penalties will apply in
certain circumstances (in accordance with the Supplementary Conditions of
Contest). Replays through the substitution of one new board shall not be
permitted after the result of a match may be known to the contestants, as to
which circumstances the Tournament Director’s decision shall be binding.
That match is scored as though the board had never been played *.
The same rules apply whenever a substitute board would normally be played,
for example, when the Executive Committee nullifies a board. When the
```

```
Tournament Director has reason to believe the Executive Committee may
wish to have a substitute board played in the final session of a match, he
should have a provisional board played during the session with an extra time
allowance of 8 minutes. The Tournament Director, on his own volition, may
instruct that a provisional board be played pending a future decision.
*Exampl e: if the 7th board in a 16-board match is fouled and the error is
discovered when the contestants are computing the result of the match, the
board is disregarded and the match is scored as though it consisted of only 15
boards, no additional IMPs will be awarded.
```
## 22.2 Fouled Boards in Pair Tournaments

```
When a board has been fouled, the Tournament Director shall determine
where the foul occurred. If guilt can be determined, penalties should be
assessed in accordance with the Supplementary Conditions of Contest.
Procedures for scoring fouled boards are contained in the Supplementary
Conditions of Contest.
```
## 23. Bidding Boxes, BridgeMates and other devices

## 23.1 Bidding boxes

```
The use of bidding boxes is mandatory throughout an APBF Championship or
Congress or Asia Cup. Starting with the dealer, players place the bidding
cards on the table in front of them, from the left and neatly overlapping so
that all calls are visible and faced towards partner; players should refrain from
touching any bidding cards until they have determined their call. A call is
considered to have been made when the bidding card(s) is removed from the
bidding box with apparent intent (but Law 25 may apply and if a player’s mind
was elsewhere as he makes an unintended call the ‘pause for thought’ should
be assessed from the moment when he first recognises his error).
Alerts should be made by the use of the alert card; it is the responsibility of
the alerting player to ensure that his opponents are aware of the Alert. STOP
card is NOT to be used. After a skip bid an opponent may pause as though
the STOP card has been used.
Until they are removed from the table, a player obtains a review of the
auction by inspecting the bidding cards. When such inspection is not feasible a
player may obtain a written review of the auction at his first turn to play to
trick one. If a player whose pass will conclude the auction removes his bidding
cards from the table he is deemed to have passed.
If screens are in use the foregoing is modified - see Section 26.
```
## 23.2 BridgeMates and other devices used for the recording of matches

```
BridgeMate IIs are currently used for the official recording of the scores
throughout the APBF Championships or Congress or Asia Cup. This
recording is the responsibility of the team sitting North/South at each table.
The E/W pair will be responsible for agreeing the score by keying in their
confirmation. The official score will be that keyed in by N/S and agreed by
E/W. Players and Captains are reminded that they are responsible for the
accuracy of their own scores. Repeated violation of correct entering
procedures may be subject to penalties.
```

## 24. Verification of Scores

The correction period in Law 79C expires upon the commencement of the next match or
segment, or - in respect of the final match or segment of any phase of the event only - 30
minutes after the final result has been posted and thereafter, the results will be final, with
the following exceptions:
 awaiting a review;
 completion of play or replay boards where such replay has been directed by the Executive
Committee.

## 24.1 Score Corrections

```
Score corrections may be made as sanctioned in Law 79 and in Laws 69 and
71.
An agreed-upon score that is proven to be erroneous to the complete
satisfaction of the Chief Tournament Director may be corrected up to 30
minutes after the posting of the scores at the end of play on each day. Only
the results of the boards played that day are subject to correction.
```
## 25. Play of the Cards

During the course of play, each card should be played towards partner in a consistent
manner and placed on the table in the same position each time so that it can be seen by all
players at the table. Quitted tricks should be placed consistently in a neat row in front of the
player, evenly overlapping with tricks won pointing towards partner and tricks lost pointing
towards the opponents.

## 26. Screen Regulations

Screens will be used whenever possible in an APBF Championship or Congress or Asia Cup.

## 26.1 Description of the Operation

```
The North and East players sit on the same side of the screen throughout. It
is North’s responsibility to place the board on, and to remove the board from,
the bidding tray. The sequence is this: North places the board on the bidding
tray after which the aperture is closed (and remains so during the entire
auction period) so that the bidding tray can just pass under it. The players
remove the cards from the board. Calls are made with the cards from the
bidding box. The player places the selected call in the bidding tray, which will
be visible only on the player’s side of the screen. A player’s first call should
touch the extreme left of his own segment of the bidding tray, with
subsequent calls overlapping neatly and evenly to the right. Players should
make every effort to perform these actions as quietly as possible. With
screens in use a call is considered ‘made’ when placed on the tray and
released. A player who removes one or more of his bidding cards from the
tray in an apparent attempt to “pass” is indeed deemed to have “passed”.
After two players on the same side of the screen have made their calls, North
or South (as the case may be) slides the bidding tray under the centre of the
screen so as to be visible only to the players on the other side. They then
make their calls in like manner and the bidding tray is slid back again. This
```

```
procedure is continued until the auction is completed. It is considered
desirable that players should vary the tempo randomly when returning the
tray under the screen. After all four players have had the opportunity to
review the auction (equivalent to the right of having the auction restated) the
players replace their bidding cards in their respective bidding boxes. The
bidding tray shall be removed from the table by a member of the declaring
side. After a legal opening lead is faced, the screen aperture is opened the
minimum necessary to permit all players to see the dummy cards and the
cards played to each trick. If a defender exposes a card and, because of the
screen, declarer does not see it, dummy may draw attention to the
irregularity.
```
## 26. 2 Alerts and Explanations

```
a) A player who makes an alertable call as defined in Appendix 2 must alert
his screen-mate, and partner must alert on the other side of the screen
when the bidding tray arrives there. The alert must be made by placing
the Alert Card over the last call of the screen-mate, in his segment of the
bidding tray; the alerted player must acknowledge by returning the Alert
Card to his opponent. A player may, by written question, ask for an
explanation of an opponent’s call; the screen-mate then provides a written
answer.
b) At any time during the Auction a player may request of his screen mate, in
writing, a full explanation of an opponent's call. The reply is also in writing.
c) At all times from the commencement of the Auction to the completion of
play each player receives information only from his screen mate about the
meanings of calls and explanations given. Questions during the play period
should be in writing with the aperture closed. The screen is raised after
the response has been made. Therefore the tournament director cannot
make enquiries on a player’s behalf on the other side of the screen during
the auction or play.
```
## 26. 3 Modifications of Laws when Screens are in Use

```
a) An irregularity passed through the screen is subject to the normal laws,
with the following provisions:
i) an inadmissible call - see Law 35 - must be corrected.
ii) if a player infringes the law and, inadvertently (otherwise Law 23 may
apply), the irregularity is passed through the screen by his screen
mate the latter has accepted the action on behalf of his side in
situations where the laws permit LHO to accept it.
b) Before an irregularity is passed through the screen the offender or his
screen mate shall draw the Director’s attention to it. Infringing calls shall
not be accepted and shall be put right without other rectification (but see
(a)(ii) above); any other irregularity shall be rectified and the Director
ensures that only the legal auction is passed through the screen. No
player on the other side of the screen shall be informed of the occurrence
unless the application of a law requires it.
c) The screen mate should attempt to prevent an opening lead out of turn.
Any opening lead out of turn shall be withdrawn without other
rectification if the screen has not been opened. Otherwise:
```

```
i) when the screen has been opened through no fault of the declaring
side (and the other defender has not led face up) Law 54 applies.
ii) when the declaring side has opened the screen the lead is accepted.
The presumed declarer becomes the actual declarer, Law 23 may
apply.
iii) when two opening leads are faced by the defending side the incorrect
lead is a major penalty card.
iv) for a card faced by the declaring side see Law 48.
d) When an alertable call is made see 26.2 above.
e) When a player takes more than a normal time to make his call, it is not an
infraction if he draws attention to the break in tempo. His screen mate,
however, shall not do so.
f) If a player on the side of the screen receiving the tray considers there has
been a break in tempo and consequently there may be unauthorised
information he should, under Law 16B2, call the director. He may do so at
any time before the opening lead is made and the screen opened.
g) Failure to do so as F provides may persuade the Director it was the
partner who drew attention to the break in tempo. If so he may well rule
there was no perceived delay and thus no unauthorised information. A
delay in passing the tray of up to 20 seconds is not regarded as significant.
h) However, if the players have not been randomising the tempo of the
auction as desired by section 26.1 paragraph 2, then a delay of less than 20
seconds may well be regarded as being significant.
```
## 27. Duplicated Boards

Whenever possible, duplicated boards will be used throughout all APBF Championships &
Congress and Asia Cup.

## 28. Attendance in Playing Rooms

Subject to any supplementary regulations made by the Executive Committee or special
permission of the President, only the following are permitted to enter the playing rooms:
a) participants assigned to play in that room;
b) Tournament Directors;
c) personnel needed to operate these tournaments, including assigned
recorders, scorers, timers, caddies and Vu-Graph personnel;
d) the President;
e) Chairman of the Organising Committee;
f) The Reviewer or his assistants;
g) staff personnel for provision of refreshment and room cleaning, if necessary;
h) “Officials on duty” appointed for a specific session or sessions by the
President;
i) a maximum of two members of the Daily Bulletin staff to be named by its
Editor;
j) a maximum of eight approved journalists who have been accredited by the
President (or his designee).
The assignments of places in the playing rooms to those in categories (i) and (j) shall be
made by the Editor of the Daily Bulletin subject to the following rules: (There are a
maximum of 10 individuals who represent categories (i) and (j). For purposes of the


following, those 10 are considered a single group and members of it are referred to as
“representatives”).
 Except by permission of the President, not more than one “representative”
shall be at any table at the same time; preference will be given to category (i).
 The “representative” must enter the room before the session begins, must
remain on the same side of the screen throughout the session and, should he
leave before the end of the session, may not re-enter any playing rooms.
 “Representatives” in categories (i) and (j) may be assigned to Open and
Closed Rooms.
 A “representative” from category (j) may not be assigned to either room of a
match that is presented on Vu-Graph. A “representative” from category (i)
may be assigned only to the Closed Room of a Vu-Graph match. However, if
both rooms of a match are being simultaneously presented on Vu-Graph,
“representatives” from all categories shall be excluded from both playing
rooms of that match.
 A “representative” from category (j) who is from the same NBO as a player
in that room, is deemed to be, for purpose of Law 11, a spectator for whose
presence at the table that player is responsible. Accordingly, the player's
consent is required for the “representative's” presence at the table.

The Executive Committee may increase the number of the approved journalists specified in
(j) above if the space available and the security conditions permit. Subject to conditions of
play, the President may permit spectators to watch matches in the Open Room. In this
event, a spectator should be seated at one side of the screen and no more than six
spectators may watch at any one table. Spectators can only watch one match. Non-playing
players from a team are not permitted to watch either own team’s match.

An individual who observes an irregularity when a spectator is subject to the inhibition in
Law 76B until a ruling on the board may no longer be sought. “Representatives” are
spectators, as also are other non-participants observing the play.

## 28.1 Restrictions

```
The following restrictions apply to the playing areas (see definition of these
areas in Section 2.16).
Spectators are not permitted to smoke or consume any alcoholic drinks in
these areas, nor may they bring mobile telephones, pagers or other electronic
equipment into these areas. Spectators contravening any of these regulations
will be required to leave the playing area immediately and will not be
permitted to return for the remainder of the Championships without specific
permission from the Chief Tournament Director.
The Chief Tournament Director may, at his discretion, prohibit a spectator
from bringing other equipment into the playing area. Anyone entering the
playing area may be required to comply with procedures put in place by the
APBF for the detection of such electronic equipment.
```
## 29. Rulings

The Tournament Director shall be summoned to a table as soon as attention is drawn to an
irregularity. After the Director has given the ruling, a request for a review may be made.


## 30. Review Following a Tournament Director’s Ruling

## 30.1 General

```
The WBF Code of Practice is utilised by the Tournament Directors before
any rulings are given, and such rulings are made in consultation with other
Directors, senior players and other personnel as appropriate.
The Code of Practice will apply. Players should note the procedures which
the Code calls upon them to adopt (as, for example, that they should
randomise and make unpredictable the tempo of passing the tray).
```
## 30.2 Request for a Review

```
A request for a review of a Tournament Director's ruling must be lodged
within 30 minutes of the first posting of the official score for the session in
which the board was played that is the subject of the ruling. All such requests
must be lodged by the team’s Captain or his designee, or by one member of
the pair in a pair ’s events.
```
## 30.3 Requests for Review Deposit

```
When lodging a Request for Review the appellant must make a monetary
deposit with the Tournament Director. The amount of deposit required will
be not less than US$100 (or its equivalent in local currency). This deposit will
be refunded unless the Reviewer determines that the request was without
merit, in which case the deposit will be forfeited.
```
## 31. Review Procedure

## 31.1 General

```
The case will be reviewed by a person who was not involved in the original
decision. The Reviewer will check that the TD has gathered the necessary
evidence of what occurred when the infraction arose. The Reviewer will then
need to be satisfied that the correct law was applied and that other TDs were
consulted where appropriate. In matters involving the judgement that was
exercised by a player following unauthorised information, incorrect
explanation or failure to alert, the Reviewer will clarify that suitable players
have been asked appropriate questions to enable a judgmental view to be
obtained. Finally the Reviewer will check that ruling that was issued based
upon all the information available to the TDs was within the bounds of
reasonableness. The fact that the Reviewer might have determined a slightly
different ruling would not be good reason for the ruling to be varied. In the
event that the process had not been followed properly in some material way,
the Reviewer will ask the Chief Tournament Director to correct the failings
and issue a new ruling.
```
## 32 Interpretation of the Bridge Laws

The interpretation of the Bridge Laws is a matter to be referred to the WBF Laws
Committee, from which three members will be appointed by the WBF President. The
decisions reached shall be final.


## 33 Interpretation of these Conditions of Contest

The interpretation of these Conditions of Contest or any Supplementary Conditions of
Contest is a matter to be referred to the Executive Committee, and 2 other members
appointed by the President. The President shall preside over this meeting and decisions
reached shall be final.

## 34 Eligibility For Awards

The APBF will establish, for each APBF Championship or Congress or Asia Cup, a scale of
APBF Master Points Awards in accordance with the APBF Master Point Plan. Gold, Silver
and Bronze Medals will normally be awarded for APBF Championships & Congress and Asia
Cup. In APBF Championships in all events, the highest-ranking team after the round robins
will be awarded the Gold Medal and/or Trophy, the 2nd ranking team will be awarded the
Silver Medal and/or Trophy, and the 3rd ranking team will be awarded the Bronze Medal
and/or Trophy. In APBF Congress in all team events, the winning team in the final will be
awarded the Gold Medal and/or Trophy. The losing finalists will be awarded the Silver Medal.
For the play off regulations to determine the Bronze Medallists, see Section 37. In all pair
events, the winning pair shall be awarded the Gold Medal and/or Trophy or prize, the
second placed pair shall be awarded the Silver Medal and the third placed pair the Bronze
Medal.

## 35 Play off Regulations for 3rd Place

The detailed play-off regulations for bronze medals or 3rd place as appropriate will be
contained within the Supplementary Regulations for each APBF Congress and Asia Cup.

## 36 Authority of the APBF Executive Committee

The APBF Executive Committee reserves the authority to modify or supplement these
Conditions of Contest and the Supplementary Conditions of Contest, at any time.

## 37 Responsibility of the APBF

The APBF schedules an APBF Championship or Congress or Asia Cup to occur at a
particular time and place. However, the APBF makes no warranty to any participating NBO,
team, pair or person, that any particular APBF Championship or Congress or Asia Cup will
take place as scheduled and accepts no responsibility for any loss or expense should it not
do so.

**46. Appendix 9: Format to Determine Zone 6 Berths to World Championships**

### Championships (if held that year)

## 46 .1 General

Zone 6 current has 3 berths each in the Open, Ladies, and Senior series; and 4 berths each
in the Junior, Youngster and Girls series. The eligibility to the berths in the Open, Ladies and
Senior categories is subject to the NBO having participated in the respective category at the
preceding World Bridge Games. Subject to stipulation in the Supplementary Conditions of
Contest otherwise, the berths are determined as follows.

## 46 .2 First Berth

The highest-ranking Zone 6 team at the end of the round robins in each of the series will
automatically earn the berth to the World Championship.

## 46 .3 Second Berth

The 2nd berth is determined by a 64-board play-off between the 2nd and 3rd ranking Zone 6
teams at the end of the round robins in each of the series. The winner of this play-off will
earn the second berth.

## 46 .4 Third Berth

The 3rd berth is determined by a 48-board play-off between the loser of 2nd/3rd play-off and
the winner of the 4th/5th play-off. The winner of this play-off will earn the third berth.

## 46 .5 Refusing the Rights

If any eligible NBO decides not to participate in the play-off, hence refusing the rights to
represent Zone 6 in the World Championship, its place will be taken up by the next highest
ranking Zone 6 team eligible in the series.
If any NBO who has earned the rights to represent Zone 6 in the World Championship
subsequently decides to withdraw, its place will be taken up by the next highest-ranking
Zone 6 team eligible in the round robin who has not yet earned the berth.

## 46 .6 Host NBO of World Championship

If the hosting NBO of a World Championship is automatically awarded a berth by the WBF,
the hosting NBO will not be included in determining the berths.

## 46 .7 Youth Teams

The top 4 finishing Zone 6 teams in the Junior, Youngster and Girls series will earn the
rights to represent Zone 6 in the World Youth Teams Championship, with the exception
that a transnational Girls team will not be eligible.
