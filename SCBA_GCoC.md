Any player or team official bringing such an item into these areas will result in his team being fined 2 VPs or in the case of pairs events, will result in his partnership being fined 25% of the match points available on a board during the session. This penalty is mandatory. Constant violation of this regulation will result in the player being prohibited from playing and in the team official not being admitted into the playing area. The Chief Tournament Director may, at his discretion, prohibit a player from bringing other equipment into the playing area. Anyone entering the playing area may be required to comply with procedures put in place by the APBF for the detection of such electronic equipment.

arranged by the APBF, including video, Internet, TV, radio or any other media presentation.

## 13. Completion of WBF Convention Card

### 13.1 Publication of Systems
Registration of Convention Cards with the APBF gives the APBF the right to publish such convention cards via Internet or to any parties at the Championship or Congress or Asia Cup in such form as it sees fit. When full systems are registered on site, for the purposes of providing additional information, these will not be published by the APBF to persons other than those requiring them for the purpose of running the Tournament.

### 13.2 Requirements
Contestants are required to make full written disclosure of their System and also to make a full disclosure of the meaning of any call or play in response to a proper question at the table from an opponent. The Supplementary Conditions of Contest will set forth detailed procedures for that disclosure, in accordance with the WBF Systems Policy and in addition to rules established in these Conditions of Contest.
The full written disclosure referred to in the above paragraph is made by the completion in due form of the WBF Convention Card and Supplementary Sheets as required. Partnerships are required to file their Convention Cards and Supplementary Sheets in accordance with the Supplementary Conditions of Contest. A Card will not be regarded as having been completed in due form for the purposes of this section unless:
a) all sections of the Card have been accurately and legibly completed, in English, in accordance with the Guide to Completion, these Conditions of Contest, and the Supplementary Conditions of Contest;
b) the Card and Supplementary Sheets contain a clear and sufficient explanation of the System used, including, without limitation, all competitive agreements and understandings, it being accepted by the APBF that the full particulars of some sequences (such as relays) which occur in later rounds of the auction, may be omitted from the Card without such omission constituting a breach of the requirement that the Card contain a clear and sufficient explanation of the System;
c) the type of System and its appropriate colour are duly indicated in the prescribed place on the Card.
d) any appropriate Brown Sticker or other forms required by the WBF Systems Policy are fully completed and appended to the Card.

## 13.3 Supplementary Sheets
a) The WBF Convention Card may be supplemented by the addition of Supplementary Sheets. The function of the Supplementary Sheets is to facilitate the full disclosure of Systems and the relationship of material on a Supplementary Sheet to material on a Card should be clearly indicated by corresponding numbers on both the Card and the Supplementary Sheet.
b) The number of Supplementary Sheets allowed, as well as the procedures for amendment and variation of Convention Cards will be set forth in the Supplementary Conditions of Contest.

## 13.4 General
a) If a player makes use of any conventional call not sufficiently described on his Card (including Supplementary Sheets), that player’s partnership may be subject to a procedural penalty (Law 90) for the infraction and/or to disciplinary penalty as well as to score adjustments to redress any damage.
b) The onus of disclosure is on the user. When there is a claim of damage through inadequate disclosure, the Tournament Director will give the benefit of any doubt to the opponents.

## 14. Use of Convention Card at Table
Unless otherwise set forth in the Supplementary Conditions of Contest, each member of a pair must hand to one of his opponents at the table during each Session of an event his duly completed Card and Supplementary Sheet(s) (incorporating any variations made pursuant to

the provisions of the Supplementary Conditions of Contest for a specific National Championships) which shall contain in the designated place on the Card an indication of the appropriate colour. These are to be reclaimed at the end of the Session. After withdrawing his cards from the board and until they are restored at the conclusion of the play, a player may not consult his own Card or Supplementary Sheets. He may consult the WBF Convention Booklet in respect of a call made by an opponent, but not in respect of a call made by his partner, or one made or contemplated by himself, and he may consult written defences against Brown sticker conventions and HUM-aspects in his
opponents system.

## 15. Alerts and Explanations
An alertable call is defined in the WBF Alerting Policy (see Appendix 2: WBF Alerting Policy). Subject to the provisions of Section 25.2 when screens are in use, the partner of a player who has made an alertable call must immediately alert his opponents unless they have stated, before the auction started on the first board of the set that they do not wish to be alerted. It is the responsibility of the alerting player to alert clearly. No explanation of the meaning of the alertable call should be made unless requested by an opponent. Request for explanation of an alertable call may be deferred until later in the auction, or until after the auction has closed in accordance with Law 20.

## 16. WBF Convention Booklet
Except in the case of initial action, whether offensive or defensive, showing two or more specified suits (for which the suits involved must be specified on the convention card) a reference on the Card to the name of a convention described in the WBF Convention Booklet which is contained on the WBF CCE or within the WBF Guide to Completion (obtainable from [http://www.ecatsbridge.com](http://www.ecatsbridge.com) Documents section) shall be deemed to incorporate on the Card the full text of the relevant convention as described in the WBF Convention Booklet. Should any modification of the description contained in the WBF Convention Booklet be used, sufficient details of such modification must appear on the Card in the appropriate section where the subject convention is named. No modification should be written on the WBF Convention Booklet itself.

## 17. Non-Playing Captains in Team Tournaments

### 17.1 General
A non-playing captain (NPC) may observe his team during play subject to the rules set forth in this Section and to any supplementary regulation made from time to time by the APBF before an National Championships begins. The NPC must enter the room before play begins at the start of a Session, and if the NPCs of both teams are in the room, they shall sit on the same side of the screen. In case of dispute the "Home Team" captain shall decide on which side of the screen they will sit. A NPC may observe play in the Closed Room at the discretion of the Chief Tournament Director.

#### 17.2 Procedure during matches
a) A NPC who leaves the room, except as provided in this Section, cannot return during that Session. Exceptionally, if the NPC is requested to leave the playing room (for the purpose of consultation or for whatever reason) by a Tournament Director, the President, or the Chairman of the Organising Committee, he may (but need not) be permitted to return to that playing room at the discretion of the Tournament Director.
b) A NPC is bound to the same restrictions as spectators (Law 76), except that he may intervene to restrain misbehaviour or curtail unnecessary discussion on the part of his team members, and may with the concurrence of the Tournament Director speak to questions of fact or law, after the Tournament Director has been called to the table, but may not call the Tournament Director.
c) During the time allowed for a Session, whether play is actually taking place at the moment or not, a NPC should not address members of his team at the table in any but the English language or in a language understood by the opponents. If it is desired to use a language other than English, the permission of the opponents should be sought, and, where reasonably possible, should be given. If difficulty arises, a NPC wishing to speak to his team in a language not known to the opponents should do so through an interpreter or team member who can translate for the benefit of the opponents.
d) At any time when a comparison of scores is allowed a non-playing Captain may draw his players’ attention to his observation of an infraction but he is bound as a spectator by Law 76B until that time.

### 17.3 Delegation of responsibility by the NPC
NPCs are responsible for the performance of various functions detailed in these Conditions of Contest and the Supplementary Conditions of Contest. While the SCBA recognises the importance of other team officials (such as coach, etc.), it is only when they are specifically named by the NPC, and have been invited to participate in the relevant National Championships by the APBF, that they may perform certain of the official functions assigned to the NPC. Such additional team officials may not enter the playing rooms unless they obtain the permission of the APBF President and the President may impose conditions on such entrance in his discretion.

## 18. Substitutes in Team Tournaments
If, for any reason, a team is unable to produce four players, either at the start of a session or because of an emergency that develops during the session, the Chief Tournament Director, in consultation with the captain of the team, may designate a substitute to complete the team. A substitute need not be a member of the NBO represented by the team on which he or she substitutes, but must not be a player from another team and may not be a male in the case of an event restricted to women.

The Chief Tournament Director, having designated a substitute, shall inform the Tournament Organising Committee and the Executive Committee as soon as practicable. The results obtained by the substitute shall stand unless the Executive Committee judges that the substitute’s bridge skills were considerably greater than those of the player replaced, in which case an adjusted score may be determined. Whether or not the result stands, the Executive Committee may impose appropriate penalties when it judges a team to be at fault.

The Executive Committee shall have authority to determine whether, and to what extent, a substitute may become a permanent replacement.

## 19. Substitutes in Pair Tournaments
The Chief Tournament Director may make emergency substitutions whenever they are necessary to the smooth operation of the game. If this will, or may, cause the resultant disqualification of any contestant, the contestant shall, where practicable, be notified at the time the substitution is made.

## 20. Forfeits in Team Tournaments
If a team is unable to play or complete a match, the Executive Committee may find that team to be in default and declare the match forfeited or postponed. The team in forfeit shall score zero Victory Points and zero IMPs for that match. The team winning the forfeited match will receive the best score between: (a) 12 VPs using the 20-0 VP scale, (b) the team’s average, or (c) the average score obtained by all the other opponents against the team at fault, whichever is greater. If it is, or becomes, necessary also to assign an IMP score for tie breaking or carry-over purposes, the winning team shall be credited with the average number of IMPs, rounded up, which earn the assigned Victory Points score.

## 21. Substitute Boards in Team Tournaments
A "substitute board" is one introduced into play in a session or a match, to replace a board already played at one or both tables. Depending upon the decision of the Chief Tournament Director, the results of a substitute board may, or may not, be counted as part of the session or match. Substitute boards are put into play by the Tournament Director either on his own volition or by direction of the Chief Tournament Director.

## 22. Fouled Boards
A board is considered "fouled" if the Tournament Director determines that one or more cards were misplaced in the board in such a manner that contestants who should have direct comparison did not play the board in identical form. If in a team event a pre-duplicated board is wrongly dealt and Law 13 of the Laws of Duplicate Bridge 2007 applies in such a way that the board cannot be played, the board is considered to be a fouled board.

### 22.1 Fouled Boards in Team Tournaments
A board is not considered fouled if the boards played in the same match are identical even though that board may differ from the like numbered board played in simultaneous matches. In general, a fouled board should be replayed through the substitution of a new board. In addition, penalties will apply in certain circumstances (in accordance with the Supplementary Conditions of Contest). Replays through the substitution of one new board shall not be permitted after the result of a match may be known to the contestants, as to which circumstances the Tournament Director's decision shall be binding. That match is scored as though the board had never been played. The same rules apply whenever a substitute board would normally be played, for example, when the Executive Committee nullifies a board. When the Tournament Director has reason to believe the Executive Committee may wish to have a substitute board played in the final session of a match, he should have a provisional board played during the session with an extra time allowance of 8 minutes. The Tournament Director, on his own volition, may instruct that a provisional board be played pending a future decision. Example: if the 7th board in a 16-board match is fouled and the error is discovered when the contestants are computing the result of the match, the board is disregarded and the match is scored as though it consisted of only 15 boards, no additional IMPs will be awarded.

### 22.2 Fouled Boards in Pair Tournaments
When a board has been fouled, the Tournament Director shall determine where the foul occurred. If guilt can be determined, penalties should be assessed in accordance with the Supplementary Conditions of Contest. Procedures for scoring fouled boards are contained in the Supplementary Conditions of Contest.

## 23. Bidding Boxes, BridgeMates and other devices

### 23.1 Bidding boxes
The use of bidding boxes is mandatory throughout an National Championships. Starting with the dealer, players place the bidding cards on the table in front of them, from the left and neatly overlapping so that all calls are visible and faced towards partner; players should refrain from touching any bidding cards until they have determined their call. A call is considered to have been made when the bidding card(s) is removed from the bidding box with apparent intent (but Law 25 may apply and if a player’s mind was elsewhere as he makes an unintended call the ‘pause for thought’ should be assessed from the moment when he first recognises his error). Alerts should be made by the use of the alert card; it is the responsibility of the alerting player to ensure that his opponents are aware of the Alert. STOP card is NOT to be used. After a skip bid an opponent may pause as though the STOP card has been used. Until they are removed from the table, a player obtains a review of the auction by inspecting the bidding cards. When such inspection is not feasible a player may obtain a written review of the auction at his first turn to play to trick one. If a player whose pass will conclude the auction removes his bidding cards from the table he is deemed to have passed.
If screens are in use the foregoing is modified - see Section 26.

### 23.2 BridgeMates and other devices used for the recording of matches
BridgeMate IIs are currently used for the official recording of the scores throughout the National Championships. This recording is the responsibility of the team sitting North/South at each table. The E/W pair will be responsible for agreeing the score by keying in their confirmation. The official score will be that keyed in by N/S and agreed by E/W. Players and Captains are reminded that they are responsible for the accuracy of their own scores. Repeated violation of correct entering procedures may be subject to penalties.

## 24. Verification of Scores
The correction period in Law 79C expires upon the commencement of the next match or segment, or - in respect of the final match or segment of any phase of the event only - 30 minutes after the final result has been posted and thereafter, the results will be final, with the following exceptions:
* awaiting a review;
* completion of play or replay boards where such replay has been directed by the Executive Committee.

### 24.1 Score Corrections
Score corrections may be made as sanctioned in Law 79 and in Laws 69 and 71. An agreed-upon score that is proven to be erroneous to the complete satisfaction of the Chief Tournament Director may be corrected up to 30 minutes after the posting of the scores at the end of play on each day. Only the results of the boards played that day are subject to correction.

## 25. Play of the Cards

During the course of play, each card should be played towards partner in a consistent
manner and placed on the table in the same position each time so that it can be seen by all
players at the table. Quitted tricks should be placed consistently in a neat row in front of the
player, evenly overlapping with tricks won pointing towards partner and tricks lost pointing
towards the opponents.

## 26. Screen Regulations

Screens will be used whenever possible in an National Championships.

### 26.1 Description of the Operation
The North and East players sit on the same side of the screen throughout. It is North’s responsibility to place the board on, and to remove the board from, the bidding tray. The sequence is this: North places the board on the bidding tray after which the aperture is closed (and remains so during the entire auction period) so that the bidding tray can just pass under it. The players remove the cards from the board. Calls are made with the cards from the bidding box. The player places the selected call in the bidding tray, which will be visible only on the player’s side of the screen. A player’s first call should touch the extreme left of his own segment of the bidding tray, with subsequent calls overlapping neatly and evenly to the right. Players should make every effort to perform these actions as quietly as possible. With screens in use a call is considered ‘made’ when placed on the tray and released. A player who removes one or more of his bidding cards from the tray in an apparent attempt to "pass" is indeed deemed to have "passed". After two players on the same side of the screen have made their calls, North or South (as the case may be) slides the bidding tray under the centre of the screen so as to be visible only to the players on the other side. They then make their calls in like manner and the bidding tray is slid back again. Thisprocedure is continued until the auction is completed. It is considered desirable that players should vary the tempo randomly when returning the tray under the screen. After all four players have had the opportunity to review the auction (equivalent to the right of having the auction restated) the players replace their bidding cards in their respective bidding boxes. The bidding tray shall be removed from the table by a member of the declaring side. After a legal opening lead is faced, the screen aperture is opened the minimum necessary to permit all players to see the dummy cards and the cards played to each trick. If a defender exposes a card and, because of the screen, declarer does not see it, dummy may draw attention to the irregularity.

### 26.2 Alerts and Explanations
a) A player who makes an alertable call as defined in Appendix 2 must alert his screen-mate, and partner must alert on the other side of the screen when the bidding tray arrives there. The alert must be made by placing the Alert Card over the last call of the screen-mate, in his segment of the bidding tray; the alerted player must acknowledge by returning the Alert Card to his opponent. A player may, by written question, ask for an explanation of an opponent’s call; the screen-mate then provides a written answer.
b) At any time during the Auction a player may request of his screen mate, in
writing, a full explanation of an opponent's call. The reply is also in writing.
c) At all times from the commencement of the Auction to the completion of
play each player receives information only from his screen mate about the
meanings of calls and explanations given. Questions during the play period
should be in writing with the aperture closed. The screen is raised after
the response has been made. Therefore the tournament director cannot
make enquiries on a player’s behalf on the other side of the screen during
the auction or play.

## 26.3 Modifications of Laws when Screens are in Use
a) An irregularity passed through the screen is subject to the normal laws, with the following provisions:
	i) an inadmissible call - see Law 35 - must be corrected.
	ii) if a player infringes the law and, inadvertently (otherwise Law 23 mayapply), the irregularity is passed through the screen by his screen mate the latter has accepted the action on behalf of his side in situations where the laws permit LHO to accept it.
b) Before an irregularity is passed through the screen the offender or his screen mate shall draw the Director’s attention to it. Infringing calls shall not be accepted and shall be put right without other rectification (but see (a)(ii) above); any other irregularity shall be rectified and the Director ensures that only the legal auction is passed through the screen. No player on the other side of the screen shall be informed of the occurrence unless the application of a law requires it.
c) The screen mate should attempt to prevent an opening lead out of turn. Any opening lead out of turn shall be withdrawn without other rectification if the screen has not been opened. Otherwise:
	i) when the screen has been opened through no fault of the declaring side (and the other defender has not led face up) Law 54 applies. 
	ii) when the declaring side has opened the screen the lead is accepted. The presumed declarer becomes the actual declarer, Law 23 may apply.
	iii) when two opening leads are faced by the defending side the incorrect lead is a major penalty card.
	iv) for a card faced by the declaring side see Law 48.
d) When an alertable call is made see 26.2 above.
e) When a player takes more than a normal time to make his call, it is not an infraction if he draws attention to the break in tempo. His screen mate, however, shall not do so.
f) If a player on the side of the screen receiving the tray considers there has been a break in tempo and consequently there may be unauthorised information he should, under Law 16B2, call the director. He may do so at any time before the opening lead is made and the screen opened.
g) Failure to do so as F provides may persuade the Director it was the partner who drew attention to the break in tempo. If so he may well rule there was no perceived delay and thus no unauthorised information. A delay in passing the tray of up to 20 seconds is not regarded as significant.
h) However, if the players have not been randomising the tempo of the auction as desired by section 26.1 paragraph 2, then a delay of less than 20 seconds may well be regarded as being significant.

## 27. Duplicated Boards

Whenever possible, duplicated boards will be used throughout all National Championships.

## 28. Attendance in Playing Rooms

Subject to any supplementary regulations made by the Executive Committee or special permission of the President, only the following are permitted to enter the playing rooms:
a) participants assigned to play in that room;
b) Tournament Directors;
c) personnel needed to operate these tournaments, including assigned recorders, scorers, timers, caddies and Vu-Graph personnel;
d) the President;
e) Chairman of the Organising Committee;
f) The Reviewer or his assistants;
g) staff personnel for provision of refreshment and room cleaning, if necessary;
h) "Officials on duty" appointed for a specific session or sessions by the President;
i) a maximum of two members of the Daily Bulletin staff to be named by its Editor;
j) a maximum of eight approved journalists who have been accredited by the President (or his designee). The assignments of places in the playing rooms to those in categories (i) and (j) shall be made by the Editor of the Daily Bulletin subject to the following rules: (There are a maximum of 10 individuals who represent categories (i) and (j). For purposes of the following, those 10 are considered a single group and members of it are referred to as "representatives").
* Except by permission of the President, not more than one "representative" shall be at any table at the same time; preference will be given to category (i).
* The "representative" must enter the room before the session begins, must remain on the same side of the screen throughout the session and, should he leave before the end of the session, may not re-enter any playing rooms.
* "Representatives" in categories (i) and (j) may be assigned to Open and Closed Rooms.
* A "representative" from category (j) may not be assigned to either room of a match that is presented on Vu-Graph. A "representative" from category (i) may be assigned only to the Closed Room of a Vu-Graph match. However, if both rooms of a match are being simultaneously presented on Vu-Graph, "representatives" from all categories shall be excluded from both playing rooms of that match.
* A "representative" from category (j) who is from the same NBO as a player in that room, is deemed to be, for purpose of Law 11, a spectator for whose presence at the table that player is responsible. Accordingly, the player's consent is required for the "representative's" presence at the table.

The Executive Committee may increase the number of the approved journalists specified in (j) above if the space available and the security conditions permit. Subject to conditions of play, the President may permit spectators to watch matches in the Open Room. In this event, a spectator should be seated at one side of the screen and no more than six spectators may watch at any one table. Spectators can only watch one match. Non-playing players from a team are not permitted to watch either own team’s match.

An individual who observes an irregularity when a spectator is subject to the inhibition in Law 76B until a ruling on the board may no longer be sought. "Representatives" are spectators, as also are other non-participants observing the play.

### 28.1 Restrictions
The following restrictions apply to the playing areas (see definition of these areas in Section 2.16). Spectators are not permitted to smoke or consume any alcoholic drinks in these areas, nor may they bring mobile telephones, pagers or other electronic equipment into these areas. Spectators contravening any of these regulations will be required to leave the playing area immediately and will not be permitted to return for the remainder of the Championships without specific permission from the Chief Tournament Director. The Chief Tournament Director may, at his discretion, prohibit a spectator from bringing other equipment into the playing area. Anyone entering the playing area may be required to comply with procedures put in place by the APBF for the detection of such electronic equipment.

## 29. Rulings
The Tournament Director shall be summoned to a table as soon as attention is drawn to an irregularity. After the Director has given the ruling, a request for a review may be made.

## 30. Review Following a Tournament Director’s Ruling

### 30.1 General
The WBF Code of Practice is utilised by the Tournament Directors before any rulings are given, and such rulings are made in consultation with other Directors, senior players and other personnel as appropriate. The Code of Practice will apply. Players should note the procedures which the Code calls upon them to adopt (as, for example, that they should randomise and make unpredictable the tempo of passing the tray).

### 30.2 Request for a Review
A request for a review of a Tournament Director's ruling must be lodged within 30 minutes of the first posting of the official score for the session in which the board was played that is the subject of the ruling. All such requests must be lodged by the team’s Captain or his designee, or by one member of the pair in a pair ’s events.

### 30.3 Requests for Review Deposit
When lodging a Request for Review the appellant must make a monetary deposit with the Tournament Director. The amount of deposit required will be not less than US$100 (or its equivalent in local currency). This deposit will be refunded unless the Reviewer determines that the request was without merit, in which case the deposit will be forfeited.

## 31. Review Procedure

### 31.1 General
The case will be reviewed by a person who was not involved in the original decision. The Reviewer will check that the TD has gathered the necessary evidence of what occurred when the infraction arose. The Reviewer will then need to be satisfied that the correct law was applied and that other TDs were consulted where appropriate. In matters involving the judgement that was exercised by a player following unauthorised information, incorrect explanation or failure to alert, the Reviewer will clarify that suitable players have been asked appropriate questions to enable a judgmental view to be obtained. Finally the Reviewer will check that ruling that was issued based upon all the information available to the TDs was within the bounds of reasonableness. The fact that the Reviewer might have determined a slightly different ruling would not be good reason for the ruling to be varied. In the event that the process had not been followed properly in some material way, the Reviewer will ask the Chief Tournament Director to correct the failings and issue a new ruling.

## 32 Interpretation of the Bridge Laws
The interpretation of the Bridge Laws is a matter to be referred to the WBF Laws Committee, from which three members will be appointed by the WBF President. The decisions reached shall be final.

## 33 Interpretation of these Conditions of Contest
The interpretation of these Conditions of Contest or any Supplementary Conditions of Contest is a matter to be referred to the Executive Committee, and 2 other members appointed by the President. The President shall preside over this meeting and decisions reached shall be final.

## 34 Eligibility For Awards
The SCBA will establish, for each National Championships, a scale of SCBA Master Points Awards in accordance with the SCBA Master Point Plan. Gold, Silver and Bronze Medals will normally be awarded for SCBA National Championships. In SCBA National Championships in all events, the highest-ranking team after the round robins will be awarded the Gold Medal and/or Trophy, the 2nd ranking team will be awarded the Silver Medal and/or Trophy, and the 3rd ranking team will be awarded the Bronze Medal and/or Trophy. In SCBA Congress in all team events, the winning team in the final will be awarded the Gold Medal and/or Trophy. The losing finalists will be awarded the Silver Medal.
